  storyText: 'This place was once a town before alien lifeforms began to took over.

    

    No
    one knew what these lifeforms are and where they came to be. When the federation
    sent a group of soldiers to investigate this place, they began exhibiting strange
    mutations after prolonged exposure to the environment. Records show that those
    who mutated decomposed into a strange pile of ooze and their essence seep back
    into the temple situated at the middle.

    

    Though research into these
    lifeforms have discovered some measures and devices to enable prolonged exposure,
    its foreboding appearance have led to the place becoming a taboo of sort. Those
    who are sentenced to death in the federation are also forcibly dragged here to
    become sustenance for whatever lifeforms lurking here.
