  title: The great maw
  storyText: "The town of the great maw was founded in the year 1500 by a group of
    adventurers who chose to settle down.\r\n\r\nHowever, what they aren't aware
    of is the presence of a parasitic creature called the \u201Cgreen leech\u201D
    that feeds on calcium and other bone related minerals. That is why the initial
    generation of people suffered from the \u201Cboneless\u201D illness where under
    certain instances, a person may be born with deformed bones or no bones at all.\r\n\r\nIt
    was only until hundreds of years ago where a cure was discovered after an expedition
    into the \u201Cgreat sea cave\u201D. They were stunt to find a strange orange-like
    fungus growing on the leeches\u2019 body and feeling on its flesh. From then
    on, people have been consuming this fungus.\r\n\r\nThe expedition and its members
    were then celebrated as famous trailblazers that helped saved the town. Every
    3 months, it is a tradition for a new group of people to be sent to the \u201Cgreat
    sea cave\u201D in hopes of searching for more hidden secrets. \r\n\r\n"
