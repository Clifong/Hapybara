  title: Dungeons of the world
  storyText: "\u201CThese are mysterious structures that only started to form 100
    years ago\u201D\r\n\r\nSince their emergence, many researchers and scholars have
    conducted field studies and explored there. Memory measurement devices have detected
    an abnormal flux of values in this area, and in deeper areas, they have a chance
    of exploding. \r\n\r\nScholars theorized that the high levels of memories are
    due to dungeons appearing in places of high conflicts and death. Many people
    who have entered those places tend to feel a vague feeling of dread and nostalgia
    because of the abundance of memories.\r\n"
