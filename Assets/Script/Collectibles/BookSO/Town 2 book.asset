  title: The frozen industrial city
  storyText: 'The city has no name and was only referred to as the frozen industrial
    city. As a former industrial colony, there are only a few livable buildings that
    can be found. However, the city gradually became abandoned when the nearby ice
    dungeon led to the rise of a parasitic creature that slowly took over some of
    the places.

    

    Due to the harsh weather and parasitic organisms, not
    many adventurers choose to come here even though the commission is extremely
    high. Only a few veteran adventurers have taken an interest in this place.

    

    The
    federation who formerly controlled this territory has decided to abandon it and
    cut all tracks leading here. Resources is quite scarce and the miniscule number
    of people still living there relied on the local wildlife and the ingredients
    produced by the monsters in the dungeon to survive.

    

    Many lament
    the somewhat poor quality of life here, and hope that one day someone would solve
    the dungeon''s issue.
