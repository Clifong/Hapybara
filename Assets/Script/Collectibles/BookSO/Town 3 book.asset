  title: Mining town, oresteine
  storyText: "This place was a former mining colony turned wasteland after a massive
    eruption took place in Mt. Surtr.\r\n\r\nThe eruption sent tonnes of ash and
    lava onto areas within 10km of its surroundings. The ashes are said to be so
    thick that it'll take approximately thousands of years before they can be decomposed.
    \r\n\r\nA research conducted by the federation revealed that these ashes will
    momentarily bind with the first few layers of the earth to form a carpet like
    layer. Bottom layer of ashes will first break down to supply the ground with
    a great amount of nutrients. And once the ashes decomposed, an unprecedented
    new wave of flora and fauna will come by.\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, the mining
    complex is still defunct and covered in ash. However, some residents still live
    there despite of the potential dangers because it is the only place they can
    live. It appears the federation has given up on transporting these people to
    a new place.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, any travelers need to take great caution
    when venturing in this place.\r\n"
