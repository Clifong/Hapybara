  storyText: "I've made a decision. \r\n\r\nThe gemstone revealed to me that there
    exist countless worlds out there, each of them expanding to form infinitely more.\r\n\r\nI'll
    escape this place before I lose all my memories, and maybe I'll bring everyone
    along.\r\n\r\nThe \u201Ctenacity\u201D radiating from it is powering my soul,
    and the ground feels weightless sometime.\r\n\r\nOnce I am done collecting enough
    raw memories, the time will come. \r\n\r\n"
