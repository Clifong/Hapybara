  title: Idyllic village of the south, ridgeville
  storyText: "A quaint village that became an unofficial hub for many novice adventurers
    and sometimes seasoned travellers.\r\n\r\nThe village's skyrocketed even further
    when a small dune-like dungeon was discovered which prompted researchers to look
    into how a completely contrasting environment could exist. \r\n\r\nDue to the
    stringent requirement posed by the village head, only a few of those who stayed
    there overtime gradually retired or chose to temporarily live there. Some became
    the tavern master, chef or even hunters. It is also why the village never seen
    a need to expand rapidly and damage the nearby wildlife.\r\n\r\nIf you have time,
    please come and visit us!\r\n"
