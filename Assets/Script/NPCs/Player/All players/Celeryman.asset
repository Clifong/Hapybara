  objectOfFaithDescription: "\u201CSo how did you end up as celeryman?\u201D\r\n\r\nSuch
    is a question posed by many who met him. \r\n\r\n\u201CBecause of a curse.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    was once an ordinary man punished to become a salaryman no matter what he does.
    Whenever he is reborn, this fact is always imprinted into his mind.\r\n\r\nNo
    one, not even him, knows the reason behind this misfortune. \r\n\r\nWhenever
    he comes of age after each reincarnation, he always try to break this cycle.
    But no matter what, none of his endeavours come to fruition.\r\n\r\nHe either
    always loses his investment.\r\n\r\nHe either always fails to get a scholarship
    no matter how perfect he is.\r\n\r\nHe always gets left out of an inheritance.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so on\u2026\r\n\r\nOnce, he went to the extreme of committing the foulest of
    acts known to humanity and even the world to gain great fortune. But alas, he
    would die before that happened.\r\n\r\nHe will never win. But neither will he
    ever lose. \r\n\r\nHowever, he noticed that whenever he dies, he would eventually
    find a stalk of celery growing in a field whenever his consciousness is about
    to dissipate.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe, this is the only change in my life\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\nAs
    a reminder of this, he took on the nickname of \u201Cwandering celeryman\u201D
    as a way to look for others who have the same fate as him.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily
    do they have to see a celery. But at the very least, maybe there's someone out
    there who can share his grief with. \r\n"
