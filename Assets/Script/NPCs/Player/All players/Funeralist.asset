  objectOfFaithDescription: "\u201CWhat's inside of this?\u201D \r\n\r\nCurious,
    you asked the young funeralist.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt's the remains of a dear friend.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    young funeralist gently caressed the surface of the coffin. \r\n\r\nIn the town
    where the sun never sets, there lies an old funeral house.\r\n\r\nWhen a person
    dies, the funeral house will seal the ashes of the dead in a coffin and pass
    them to a friend or family. \r\n\r\nWhen that person died, no one wanted to claim
    the coffin except for her. After all, that person was an orphan who lived in
    the streets and refused to accept her constant goodwill.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don't
    want to trouble you\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\nEventually, that person would perish after
    the great plague came, not before passing on a wish.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe sea\u2026
    I want to go there.\u201D\r\n\r\nThus, she decided to hand over the funeral house
    to her family and embark on this treacherous journey. \r\n\r\nA funeralist would
    never betray a promise to the departed after all.\r\n"
