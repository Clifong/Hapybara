  objectOfFaithName: Lantern of a world beyond
  objectOfFaithDescription: "The lantern itself reveals a world of what could have
    been.\r\n\r\nFaters are always seen with a lantern in their hands. Each lantern
    is unique and shows the fate of a person in that world.\r\n\r\nTheir organization
    are so mysterious that no one knows how the lanterns came to be, or how this
    group of people came together.\r\n\r\nThe fater currently beside you has a lantern
    of you. Naturally, she has taken an interest in you.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can see vague
    details of your future, but I am not able to see everything\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C...
    We have a saying here: A person's story is a predetermined train ride, but the
    logic of this world has made it such that one can still derail it. You are the
    very element of unpredictability in your own journey.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she gaze
    at the lantern, you can sense a strange feeling of anticipation from her.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn
    that case, do you there exist a lantern of you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed there
    is, but lanterns are either hidden away or given to others. I have no clue which
    is the outcome\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\nShe gently picked up the lantern and headed
    back. But before leaving, she smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\u201C... If it was in
    the hands of another fater, no doubt they'll feel the thrill of seeing me making
    decisions. And as for me, I look forward to what you'll do.\u201D\r\n"
