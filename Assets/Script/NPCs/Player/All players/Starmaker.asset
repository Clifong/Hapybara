  lore: An old man who seeks to complete his final journey

  objectOfFaithName: Fading star
  objectOfFaithDescription: "Star-making is a profession open to a certain few. They
    are those whose affinity with the memories is high, and can physically interact
    with it.\r\n\r\nFor generations, they offer a service to capture the memories
    inside the dungeon and convert them into \u2018catalysed fragments\u2019. \r\n\r\nBefore
    their death, starmakers are known to remove their memories. But this will leave
    them in an amnesiac and sometimes senile state.\r\n\r\nHe is at the last leg
    of his life, with only a few more years remaining.\r\n\r\nWith what vitality
    that is left in his body, he chose to embark on a journey for old time's sake.\r\n\r\n\u201CBack
    when I was still young, I ventured across the land with my companions. Most of
    them have either retired or met their end before that\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C...
    I chose to go on my own.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that not akin to suicide? You
    have never been good at fending monsters.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, but that doesn't
    mean I'll not meet anyone new. Life is full of twists and turns, and I've decided
    to see how things go.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe stood up and left with nothing more than
    a bag of gold and a fading star.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the horizons beyond.\r\n\r\nThe
    night sky looked as beautiful as ever. But now that he chose to continue forward,
    the sky felt more beautiful than ever.\r\n\r\nLooking at the fading star in his
    hands, he was reminded of what he said to his apprentice.\r\n\r\n\u201CEveryone's
    destiny is like a star in the sky. There are times where we are the brightest,
    and there are times when we become dull. But as long as the light in us continues
    to flicker, we should not let the darkness of the sky consume us.\u201D\r\n"
