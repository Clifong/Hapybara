  objectOfFaithName: Endless cube
  objectOfFaithDescription: "A cube with no beginning nor end. To the VOID, the cube
    is a manifestation of its existence - a logical anomaly.\r\n\r\nIt simply appeared
    when the world was created. It began wandering across the land, witnessing the
    rise and fall of many kingdoms, the birth and death of many people, and the blossoming
    and decay of wildlife throughout.\r\n\r\nWhen the dungeons first came to existence,
    it was drawn to the memories sealed in there.\r\n\r\n\u201CMemories are proof
    of one's existence. Since I want to know how to \u2018exist\u2019, I should consume
    them.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, memory loss to the VOID is immediately rejected.\r\n\r\nNo
    matter how much it consumes, it can never achieve its goal.\r\n\r\nWhen rumours
    of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began to spread among
    a few people, it concluded.\r\n\r\n\u201CAn object that is both an anomaly and
    creation of this world\u2026 Perhaps it could be a solution.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u2588\u2588\u2588

    mine.\r\n"
