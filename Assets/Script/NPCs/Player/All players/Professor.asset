  objectOfFaithDescription: "A piece of book filled with the wisdom of this world,
    he took the opportunity to leave a place he once looked up to.\r\n\r\nAll he
    could think of were the endless hours poured to perfect his work, only to be
    dismissed by pompous know it all. \r\n\r\nEventually, the thing that broke the
    camel's back was a betrayal that tarnished his reputation and led to his dismissal.\r\n\r\nHe
    felt a mixture of bitterness, freedom and hatred. No longer will he need to appease
    those people.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering from place to place with what little savings
    he had, he chose to settle in a small idyllic village.\r\n\r\nAs a living, he
    became a teacher. Stained by his past, he couldn't muster any vigour.  \r\n\r\n\u201CWhy
    choose to be something you have no interest in?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C... It's the
    only thing I know.\u201D\r\n\r\nEventually, even he couldn't afford to stay there.
    But before he left, he stumbled across a young boy.\r\n\r\nHe handed him a small
    notebook, stating that he was still appreciative of his teaching.\r\n\r\nOn the
    first page, there was a note.\r\n\r\n\u201CMay you find joy once more.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis
    heart felt a lost and familiar feeling of warmth again. The memories of passing
    on knowledge that grew dull would brighten up once more.\r\n\r\nThough it wasn't
    enough to fill up the void that his passion left behind, at least it gave him
    a push to rekindle what he had lost.\r\n"
