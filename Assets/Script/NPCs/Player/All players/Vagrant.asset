  objectOfFaithDescription: "Vagrants are said to be people who have no home. For
    him, this is something he wholeheartedly agrees with.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf home is
    a place where you can feel warmth and solace, then I don't think I have one\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C...
    The life of a vagrant is something. No matter where you stay, you can never feel
    true comfort.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn his words, young people romanticize his life for
    being so free, yet are unaware of how much burden it has.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't really
    talk much, probably because of his lifestyle.\r\n\r\nYou vaguely know that he
    was the child of a once well-known family that fell to ruins after a certain
    wall.\r\n\r\nBeing forced out of his comfortable lifestyle has toughened his
    initially frail body. To survive, he sometimes had to endure the harsh weather
    and people, scavenge whatever food he could find, and seek shelter in whatever
    \u2018livable\u2019 place is around him.\r\n\r\n\u201CUsually, most people choose
    to end their life after such an incident. They could not bear to live the life
    of a peasant.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen, do you think things will ever get better?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CProbably
    not. \u201C\r\n\r\n\u201CThen why choose to live?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe world
    will always be harsh to those who have not yet found their way back, and to live
    is to continue searching for that missing path. I will not let myself be dampened
    by tragedies, but instead, let it guide me to another path that I would have
    never taken.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C...\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow about I play you a
    little tune, eh?\u201D\r\n"
