  objectOfFaithDescription: "There was once a kingdom that sought to connect with
    the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nTo do so, they decided to fund and create a global
    railway track. It is said that a single journey would span a month. And to show
    their goodwill, a conductor would be sent out to offer the leader of other countries
    gifts. \r\n\r\nOne of the conductors never made it after a strange cyclone appeared
    out of nowhere and threw him overboard. \r\n\r\nWhen he woke up, he was found
    by a group of villagers. As a thank you to them, he decided to lay a train track
    to connect them to the world.\r\n\r\nEver since then, he has been expanding the
    track system day by day, until he reach his initial destination.\r\n"
