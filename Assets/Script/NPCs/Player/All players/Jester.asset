  objectOfFaithDescription: "What's life without some unpredictability?\r\n\r\nWhat's
    life if you cannot lose yourself?\r\n\r\nWhat's life if you have to be shackled?\r\n\r\nThe
    jester lives his life without any worry. \r\nMoney? Just beg for some or perform
    for it!\r\n\r\nHome? Everywhere is their home! \r\n\r\nFun? Everything is!\r\n\r\nThe
    world itself is a never-ending game. Every moment is to be savoured and enjoyed
    as if it was your last.\r\n\r\nAnd when everything around crashes, don't ever
    regret making this choice.\r\n"
