  objectOfFaithDescription: "A piece of parchment with the lyrics of a song on it.\r\n\r\nThis
    song is the bard's favorite even after many years of traveling around. When his
    homeland fell when he was still young after a monster attack, the survivors left
    with nothing more than a few personal items. \r\n\r\nOne day, they were attacked
    by a few monsters and were saved by a bard who used his voice to soothe the wild
    beasts. The bard then decided to tag along to gain more inspiration before parting
    ways when a new place was found.\r\n\r\nHe could fondly remember the song the
    bard played when times were bad. \r\n\r\n\u201CTo another day without sorrow
    and another with renewed hope. We shall go to a brighter tomorrow.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor
    him, that song will always remind him to move forward and to lift those who have
    fallen.\r\n"
