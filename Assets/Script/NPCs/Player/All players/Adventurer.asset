  objectOfFaithName: Shattered sword
  objectOfFaithDescription: "The surface of the sword is covered in impenetrable
    rust. When you first ask the adventurer about it, he says that it belonged to
    his mentor. \r\n\r\nHe was an adventurer famed throughout the lands but ultimately
    met his demise at the hands of a parasite. The monster was also defeated, and
    so when the survivors returned, all they could find was the shattered sword.\r\n\r\nAs
    a promise to his best apprentice, the fragments will be given to him. \r\n\r\n\u201CWas
    this a reminder of the risk of his role?\u201D You asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, it's
    a reason to keep moving forward. We will pick up from where our seniors fall,
    and continue fulfilling their dreams for a better tomorrow as this is the will
    of an adventurer.\u201D\r\n"
