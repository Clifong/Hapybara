  objectOfFaithDescription: "An odd-looking dream catcher.\r\n\r\n\u201CWelcome to
    my dream.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut this is\u2026 the real world?\u201D \r\n\r\nThe
    day she got the dreamcatcher was the day her career as a treasure hunter ended.\r\n\r\nEvery
    since she came into contact with it, her perception of \u201Cdream\u201D and
    \u201Creality\u201D became blurred as she constantly phases between both states.
    Sometimes, her dreams become so lifelike that reality is not so much different
    from it.\r\n\r\nForsaken by everyone who was fed up with her delusions, she wandered
    the lands staving off fruits and berries.\r\n\r\nOnly after many years, did her
    \u201Cdreams\u201D start to merge more and more with the fabric of \u201Creality\u201D
    and she was able to bring in small objects from that world.\r\n\r\nThough her
    mind has already been lost to the curse of the dreamcatcher, there still lies
    a shard of hope in her to free herself from it.\r\n\r\nShe saw \u2588\u2588\u2588
    \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in one of her many dreams, an object not of this
    world. Perhaps only something that is beyond the laws of the world contains secrets
    that can rid the curse in her.\r\n\r\nAnd until \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588
    ceases to exist, she will keep on moving.\r\n"
