  objectOfFaithName: A story lost in the sea of memories
  objectOfFaithDescription: "I was a girl sleeping soundly in bed.\r\n\r\nI was a
    man who came back from a long day of working.\r\n\r\nI was a grandmother looking
    back on her past.\r\n\r\nIn just a single day, an entire kingdom and their memories
    were swallowed by the great disaster\r\n\r\n\u201CI am their imprint on their
    world, the only proof of their existence.\u201D\r\n\r\nFleeting mirages are beings
    that should not exist. Memories swallowed by the world are destroyed immediately,
    and none should escape.\r\n\r\nBut in a rare occasion, those that do merged to
    form a cacophony of disjointed memories.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut for so many different
    people to work together, does that mean a compromise is made?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    all yearn for a single thing, to find a way to separate ourselves. This form
    we're taking is a prison in of itself\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C... We heard rumors
    of an otherworldly object capable of splitting us. But we aren't the only fleeting
    mirages that exist. In the path ahead, we will cross paths with the rest.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill
    you be ready to throw hands at them?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a punishment for
    anyone to suffer such a fate. But I will have to be selfish to save ourselves.
    But if that object can still be reused, then I'll save them too.\u201D\r\n"
